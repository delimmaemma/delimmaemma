## About Me:

After graduating from the University of North Texas with my Bachelor's in finance, I briefly worked in the field at the Bank of New York Mellon. Soon after my graduation, I learned that finance was not for me, and began looking at other options. After finding Bloom Institute of Technology, I started working on getting my certificate in full-stack web development, where I am currently working to complete the program by the end of November. I am learning that programming is much more my niche, along with problem solving and mathematical computation and patterns.

## Technical Skills:

Microsoft Office | Bloomberg Access Terminal | SPSS | Wall Street Office | ReconNET | Amazon Workspace | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Node.js | React.js | Cypress | Postman

## Experience:

While having no official coding job experience, I believe that results speak far louder than individual experience. As such, I hope to leverage my coding results to gain invaluable experience working the industry.

## Next Moves:

Upon graduation from BloomTech, I hope to land a remote or hybrid job working in full-stack web development and utilizing my financial background to specialize in finance related webpages.
