## 🚀 Passionate Web Developer | Open to Exciting Front-end and Full-stack Opportunities
Welcome to my corner of the digital world! 👋 I'm a determined and dynamic web developer on the lookout for junior to mid-level roles in front-end or full-stack development. My journey into the tech realm began after realizing my knack for programming, problem-solving, and the intricate dance of mathematical patterns.

## 🎓 Educational Transition
Following my Bachelor's in Finance from the University of North Texas, I gained hands-on experience at the Bank of New York Mellon. However, the allure of finance faded, leading me to pivot to a more fulfilling path. Enrolling at Bloom Institute of Technology, I earned my stripes in full-stack web development, proudly completing the program in October.

## 💻 Tech Arsenal
Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I wield the power of React for creating engaging user interfaces. Node.js and Express are my go-to for server-side magic, with SQL and SQLite3 managing data seamlessly. I'm currently expanding my backend expertise with Java, eager to delve into SpringBoot.
