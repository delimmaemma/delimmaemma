## About Me:

After graduating from the University of North Texas with my Bachelor's in finance, I worked in the field at the Bank of New York Mellon. Soon after my graduation, I learned that finance was not for me, and began looking at other options. After finding Bloom Institute of Technology, I started working on getting my certificate in full-stack web development, where I recently completed the program in October. I am learning that programming is much more my niche, along with problem solving and mathematical computation and patterns.

## Technical Skills:

Microsoft Office | Bloomberg Access Terminal | SPSS | Wall Street Office | ReconNET | Amazon Workspace | React.js | Redux | Hooks | Context API | Cypress | Yup | Axios | Javascript | HTML | CSS | Node.js | Express | SQL | SQLite3 | Java | Github | VS Code | Vercel | Heroku | Postman API | Algorithms | Architecture | Debugging | Deployment

## Experience:

While having no official coding job experience, I believe that results speak far louder than individual experience. As such, I hope to leverage my coding results to gain invaluable experience working the industry.

## Next Moves:

I am currently seeking remote job opportunities in front-end or full-stack web development specializing in React and/or RDBMS.
